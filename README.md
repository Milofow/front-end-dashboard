# Home automation dashboard front-end
I'm creating a dashboard to control my IoT's in my home with. This repo is the front-end but it also requires a back-end which can be found [here](https://github.com/Milofow/devices-service). This dashboard provides:

- CRUD for your devices
- Login service using Auth0



## Run application
To run this application you'll also need the back end service that can be found [here](https://github.com/Milofow/devices-service).

First you'll have to run `npm install` to install the needed dependencies from the `package.json` file.

Then to start the project you can run `npm start`.

To run tests inside my project run `npm test`.
